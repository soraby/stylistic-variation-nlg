## Overview
The PersonageNLG corpus is a set of 88,000 meaning representation to natural language utterance pairs in the restaurant domain (train) and 1,390 pairs (test), based on the [E2E Challenge dataset](https://github.com/tuetschek/e2e-dataset). The utterances vary in style according to psycholinguistic models of personality, and provides a resource for natural language generation of restaurant descriptions in different Big-Five personalities.

## Data
The data available for download is a zip of 2 CSVs files (one for train, one for test) containing meaning representations and their corresponding natural language utterances for a subset of the  Big-Five personalities (agreeable, disagreeable, conscientious, unconscientious, and extravert), generated using the [Personage statistical generator (Mairesse and Walker, 2010)](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~maw/papers/umuai2010.pdf).
